## Graduation Project

### [Rosheta - Medical OCR](https://github.com/AlaaErfan/Medical-OCR)
- **Description:** This project aims to ease the reading of Egyptian medical prescriptions and provide an alternative drug for each drug mentioned in the prescription through the scientific name.
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Huggingface, Doxapy, Solt
- **Details:**
  - The project contains three main pipelines (preprocessing - English - Arabic) with more than 8 models performing different tasks, including classification for preprocessing functions, handwritten OCRs for English and Arabic languages, autocorrection, and spelling correction NLP algorithms.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Conducted data exploration and analysis, including data collection and data cleaning.
    - Manually collected and constructed medical data.
    - Found the most optimal combination of models to be used in pipelines.
    - Finetuned T5 for autocorrection.
    - Applied error functions to prepare the data for T5.
    - Applied transfer-learning techniques for OCR models to improve model performance and make better use of limited resources.
    - Trained YOLO on custom data for line segmentation and used different functions for line segmentations.
    - Researched and tested common NLP algorithms for spelling corrections to find the suitable algorithm.
